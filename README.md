# Stock_Market_Value_Prediction

Here we have made the predictions of the stocks of 500 S&P 500 companies of the New York Stock Exchange over the period by using multiple layers of neural networks.

The LSTM model used by us further told the accuracy of the tradeoff between the future forecasted value of the stocks and their effects on the stock values of different companies in that particular LSTM depth.
We tested the model over 50,000 test points over 500 different companies.
